# Ignite Feed

A Studying Project for React and TypeScript Fundamentals

## Description

### About the Project

This project is a minimal setup to get React working with TypeScript, using Vite as the development server. The application displays a feed of posts, each with an author, content, and publication date. Users can interact with the posts by liking and commenting on them.

### Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with React and TypeScript, focusing on the following key areas:

- React fundamentals: components, props, state, hooks, and event handling
- TypeScript basics: type annotations, interfaces, classes, and type inference

### Acknowledgments

This project is based on the Ignite Feed template provided by Rocketseat. I'd like to thank the Rocketseat team for creating this template and making it available for developers to learn and grow.
